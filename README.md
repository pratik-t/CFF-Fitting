This project contains my progress on the CFF fitting problem. 


In multiple papers like https://journals.aps.org/prc/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevC.92.055202, defined:


Unpolarised differential cross section: 

$d^4\sigma = \frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{d^4\sigma(\lambda=+1)}{dQ^2dx_Bdtd\phi}+\frac{d^4\sigma(\lambda=-1)}{dQ^2dx_Bdtd\phi}\right]$

Helicity-dependent differential cross section:

$\Delta^4\sigma = \frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{d^4\sigma(\lambda=+1)}{dQ^2dx_Bdtd\phi}-\frac{d^4\sigma(\lambda=-1)}{dQ^2dx_Bdtd\phi}\right]$
